# My-Audiobook
I hate reading and this why I just wrote few lines of python code so that I don't have to read 
anymore and by this even you don't have to read anymore?
This is very simple python code and I just write it in simple 4 steps and then I can make
any pdf book just reading to me and I just lay down on my bed and listen to it. How fun that would be!!
